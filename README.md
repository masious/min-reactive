# min-reactive

a minimalistic tool to avail reactivity to a webpage, without doing anything else, and without pulling off magic
behind the scenes to mask the developer from what is really happening.

so the goals of this project are:

- it should only bring reactivity and nothing more.
- it should be extremely transparent and simple on how it does that.
- it should be flexible, extensible and composible.

lets see how stuff shake out.
